To view the current pin map either download the KML above and open in the program of your choice or go to the following link to open on google maps https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1BAEW0OWRQGhfEn7RrLxvj0KWII5e7gp0&ll=-36.87075356725338%2C174.65671800964202&z=12

## How to add pins
To help assist us reduce the likelihood of duplicate pins check to see if anyone else is working on the same area first by looking in the issues tab. If there is not a open issue please create one just letting everyone know what area your working on. If there is a open ticket with the same area your interested in then feel free to post a comment on the issue asking if they need a hand.

To add pins do not change the KML above.

Go To My Google Maps and create a new map.

Click Import and upload the google_maps_template.csv this will add the required fields(Fixture Count, Allowed Use) to Google Maps

Add your pins. Please also include the number of parks and the Allowed Use(Public or Customer Only)

When done export to KML(3 dots next to the map name -> Export to KML/KMZ -> Select your layer with pins and select "Export as KML instead of KMZ. Does not support all icons.")

Fork this project this will create a clone of this project within your github account. Place the KML file downloaded from google into the User Contributed directory make the File name your username(this will add your username to the pin data on output This will also be your file so any changes you make should be added to your own file).

Create a pull request

## Something wrong with a User Contributed pin
If you feel confident doing so feel free to update the users KML file with the correct data and submit a pull request.
If you would prefer someone else to fix the KML file open a issue.

## Duplicate Pins
It is likely that at some point 2 or more people will make the same pin. If this happens open a issue
